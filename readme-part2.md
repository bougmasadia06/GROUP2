## Description
This is a console application for managing university student records and fees. The program allows users to add students to a database, search for specific students by ID, and view payment statistics. It tracks information like tuition fees, payments made, scholarship status, and calculates remaining balances. In Part 2, we added classes, loops, and data structures to make the system more organized and powerful.
