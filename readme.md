## Description
This Python program helps manage student information. It asks users to enter student details step by step, including personal data, academic records, and payment information. The program then works out important calculations like remaining fees, paid percentage, and monthly payment amounts. Finally, it shows all the student's information in a clear summary that is easy to read and use.
